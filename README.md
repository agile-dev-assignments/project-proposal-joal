Proposal by @AlexanderBobb and @jw5374

# Chess Game Website

## What and why?
We want to build a chess website that includes the game itself, and information about things about the history, and tutorials about the basic rules and ideas of the game.

## For whom?
It's for people just like us that are interested in the game of chess, and that perhaps might not know that much about it and want to learn.

## How?
We're thinking that when the users land on the page they will be presented with the game where they can play a bot (as a board) which will include settings for time controls, with links to connecting pages that:
* Teach some basic mechanics (like a "Learn" page) that can include
    * Piece movement
    * Basic patterns (checks, forks, skewers, etc.)
    * Basic checkmates (like mate in 1, or mate in 2)
    * Mechanics like castling and en passant
    * much more
* Possibly a "Practice" page (contingent on how difficult it would be to hook something like Stockfish to our website)
    * where one can move pieces freely, and check the evaluation
    * Chess puzzles
* General information page which may talk about things like the history or notable people in the game.

## Scope?
We think programming the board and piece rules would not be too difficult, but adding the bot and separate pages/features can be as complicated or simple as we want to make it. There isn't a ceiling to the complexity and we feel it can be tailored to the time that we are allotted.
